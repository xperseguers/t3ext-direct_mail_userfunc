What does it do?
----------------

This extension adds an entry "External provider" to the drop-down list of Direct Mail's recipient list definition:

.. figure:: ../Images/type_userfunc.png
	:alt: List of recipient prepared with a provider

This special type of recipient list lets you dynamically generate the list of recipients.

In short, this means that with a standard user function, you are able to use any logic you wish to define the
recipients. A typical example would be to read the information from an external source, such as a legacy application or
a custom database table. Another example, if having an Extbase-based extension, would be to reuse your domain model and
use it as a source to feed the recipient list.

   found and method "myRecipientList" exists).

#. Icon |wizard| informs you that a wizard is available to configure the additional parameters. Simply click on it to
   invoke a user-generated script.

In case either the class or the method was not found, an warning message is shown that explains what is wrong with the
provider definition.
